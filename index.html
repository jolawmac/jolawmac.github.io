	<h2>Quick history lesson of Josh McDonald</h2>
	<p class="my-history"> Growing up watching movies like Indian Jones and of course all the hours spent watching History Channel shows only added to my interest in archeology. History is one of my favorite subjects to read and study. I've always had a love for old things. I used to scour the woods behind our house for old Inidan artifacts. I also used to spend hours in antique stores just looking around. I first got involved in archeology in my undergrad studies. Since that time in 2006 I've been on several great archeological expeditions in Israel. This website is about those expeditions. Thanks for checking out my story!</p>

	<p>The picture above was also taken at Tel Gezer. These are some of the tools used when in the field: buckets, wheelbarrow, sifter, and sand bags.</p>
	<p>Here is a website with more detail on the expeditions at <a href="http://www.telgezer.com"> Tel Gezer</a></p>
	<p>If that website doesn't work (the professor may be updating the website as they are currently digging on site) some of the same information is covered in the wikipedia page of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezer">Tel Gezer</a></p>

	<p>As the above table mentions I've had the privilage of working on three specific cites: Qumran, the Temple Mount, and Tel Gezer. As usual at all three sites we've dug up some incredible things. Below is a picture of three ancient juglets made of pottery that date back to 1000 B.C. All three jars come from Tel Gezer in Israel.</p>
	<div style="text-align: left"><img height="300" width="350"  src="IMG_3079.jpg" alt="Ancient Pottery"></div>
	<p>Here are some other cool items we've found:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Coins</li>
		<li>Slingstones</li>
		<li>Spears</li>
		<li>Bone fragments (human and animal)</li>
		<li>Jewelry</li>
		<li>Plenty of pottery items</li>
		<li>Board game made of ivory</li>
	</ol>
	<p>There are several articles on the internet that describe in detail our work done in Tel Gezer. During our summer 2014 dig we worked during Operation Protective Edge, a war against Hamas. At times we had to run for shelter as bombs were going off in fields near us. We also made some great archeological finds. One of those as mentioned above was a board game made of ivory. You can find some of this informaion on one of the articles from ASOR <a href="http://asorblog.org/cause-view/digging-at-tel-gezer-during-operation-protective-edge/">here.</a></p>

	<p><a href="http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/">Biblical Archeology</a></p>
	<p class="info">The above link is another great site about biblical archeology. This website is full of great information from great scholars. This website is coded very well. Everything from the placement and amount of links to the semantics of the page itself are incredible. Its so cool to look at the source code and understand some things. This website has done a great job with tags and links. If I wanted to improve my index.html page I could use some pointers from his website. When comparing it to my page some imporvements I could make are: better organization for the information I am providing, better placement of images, and more links. The website has a very nice layout as well.</p>
